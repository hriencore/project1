    <div class="hi"><p>My Dearest,</p>

        <p>It feels as though time has been both swift and eternal since we began this wondrous journey together. In the span of just over one year, you have become the melody that lingers in my heart, the warmth that keeps the chill of the world at bay. Our love, like the most delicate sonnet, has been crafted through every word, every glance, and every moment we‚Äôve shared.<br><br>
      
        To quote William Shakespeare, ‚ÄúWhen I saw you I fell in love, and you smiled because you knew.‚Äù My heart has never known a truth so pure‚Äîevery second with you feels like a timeless eternity, one where I am bound to you, utterly, irrevocably, in the most harmonious of unions.<br><br><img id="jumbo" src="5323a45c-9af8-4ec3-968f-b8c2edfcf454_removalai_preview.png" alt="">
      
        The way your laughter weaves through the air like a symphony, the way your gaze drowns me in a sea of affection, is a kind of poetry only the soul can truly comprehend. You are my muse, the force that propels me into a better version of myself. In the words of Pablo Neruda, ‚ÄúI love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul.‚Äù<br><br>
      
        The passion we share is not fleeting‚Äîit is a fire that has been stoked by the quiet moments as much as the loud, joyous ones. From our silences to our conversations that stretch into the night, I find every part of you to be a song that plays endlessly in my heart. It‚Äôs in the little things‚Äîthe touch of your hand, the way you speak my name, the softness of your smile‚Äîthat I find my eternity.<br><br>
      
        A year and a bit together feels like the beginning of an endless voyage with you, and yet, there is still so much we have yet to experience, so much love we have yet to give. As the great Emily Dickinson said, ‚ÄúForever is composed of nows,‚Äù and with you, every moment is an echo of forever.<br><br><img id="jumbo2" src="5323a45c-9af8-4ec3-968f-b8c2edfcf454_removalai_preview.png" alt="">
      
        With you, I have learned the true meaning of love. It is not merely a fleeting feeling, but a steadfast commitment‚Äîan unbreakable bond forged in moments both grand and minute. To be with you is to know what it means to truly live. You are the heart of my existence, the compass that guides me. In your eyes, I find not just the love of a lifetime, but the love of eternity.<br><br>
      
        As we continue to walk this path, hand in hand, I promise you my unwavering devotion, my deepest affection, and my infinite gratitude. You are my everything, my forever, and no distance nor time can ever diminish the depth of my love for you.<br><br>
      
        With all the love I have to give,<br></div>
